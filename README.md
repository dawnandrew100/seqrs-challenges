# seq.rs-challenges

Welcome to **seq.rs-challenges**! 
This repo is a collection of monthly coding challenges
focused on **bioinformatics in Rust** ðŸ¦€.

This repository serves as the home for:
-  **Monthly bioinformatics challenges** posted on [seq.rs](https://dawnandrew100.github.io/seq.rs/)
-  Community Rust solutions
-  Discussions around performance, algorithms, and problem-solving in Rust

Whether you're a beginner to Rust or an experienced bioinformatician, these challenges are a great way to sharpen your skills!

##  How It Works

1. **New Challenge Every Month**  
   A new bioinformatics coding challenge is published at the start of
   each month.

2. **Solve in Rust**  
   Use idiomatic, performant, and readable Rust to tackle the problem.

3. **Submit Your Solution**  
   Fork this repo, create a folder under the current month's directory using
   your GitHub username, add your solution, and open a pull request.
   See full [submission instructions](#submission-instructions) below.

4. **Join the Discussion**  
   Share your approach, and ask questions in the
   [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dawnandrew100/seqrs-challenges/discussions).


## Submission Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Navigate to the appropriate challenge folder `year/month/`
3. Create a new folder in `submissions/` with your GitHub username
4. Place your `.rs` files and any additional code in your folder
5. Open a Pull Request with the title: `Add solution for <MONTH-YEAR> by <USERNAME>`
6. (Optional) Include a short write-up in a `README.md` inside your folder

## Why Rust for Bioinformatics?

Rust provides:
- **Performance** like C/C++
- **Safety** without garbage collection
- **Modern syntax** and tooling
- A growing ecosystem for scientific computing

Rust can also integrate into python workflows using crates like
[py03](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).


## About seq.rs

[**seq.rs**](https://dawnandrew100.github.io/seq.rs/) is a blog
exploring algorithms, tools, and experiments in
**bioinformatics using Rust**.

Each monthly challenge is inspired by topics I find interesting,
recent papers in the bioinformatics field, or community suggestions.
