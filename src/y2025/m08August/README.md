## August Challenge

Natural language processing (NLP) consists of many powerful components.
Try programming it on your own!

Some core tasks you can implement include:

- Text Tokenization – Splitting text into smaller units called tokens
(words, phrases, or symbols).
- Word Lemmatization – Reducing words to their base or dictionary form.
- Part-of-Speech Tagging – Assigning grammatical categories
(noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each token.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Detecting and classifying proper nouns
like people, places, or organizations.
- Coreference Resolution – Identifying when different words refer to the same
entity within a text.

### Bonus Challenge

Combine multiple NLP components into a pipeline that performs more sophisticated
tasks.

#### Example: Grammar Correction Pipeline

Create a system that:

- Tokenizes the input.
- Tags each word with its part of speech.
- Detects grammar issues (e.g., verb tense mismatches, subject-verb disagreement).
- Suggests corrections using lemmatization and rules (or a small ML model).
- Reconstructs the corrected sentence.
